# Combatant
 
Combatant allows you to host fully-automated custom Valorant matches/scrims in your server and verify Riot accounts with Discord users. I found no other bots that do this so I made my own. To create a verification prompt, use the v!createverify command in the channel you want the prompt to be in. Also, make sure there is a role in your server called Valorant Linked. That's all you have to do to set it up! To host custom games, you'll need a role called Host in your server. Only people with this can host custom games. If you want to host, use the v!startmatch <description> command. Players will have to react with ✋ (they will receive the host's Riot ID and instructions on how to join). Also, make sure your Valorant lobby is on public so players can join. Once a lot of people react with ✋, the host has to react with ✅ to dispatch the game (close it so no one else can join). Then, start the game in Valorant! That's it!
